## Overview
 Loan default occurs when a borrower fails to pay back a debt according to the initial arrangement.. The higher loan defaulter rate is shown as failure of bank to identify eligible customer for loan.

**Impact of Loan Default  on Business**
Banks mainly make money from the interest they charge on loans, and when they are unable to collect the owed interest payments from NPLs, it means that they will have less money available to create new loans and pay operating costs. When the percentage of non-performing loans increases, the lenderâ€™s stock price will also go down. The NPLs a bank holds in its books, the less attractive it is for potential investors because its future profitability will suffer if the lender will not earn an income from its credit business.
 According to Deloitte, the average cost-per-hire is $4,000. This cost can be vary by country,region,industry,
 
 So loan default  is vital problem  and need to build suitable model and identify what are the key factor which lead to loan default.
 
 
 ## Problem_Definition
 One leading institute  is facing challenges about loan default rate where customer  not paying loan amount as per agreements. 
 
 The institute   is trying to address this problem by identifying patterns in their existing loan defaulteres  using Machine learning algorithms.
 

 
## Exploratory_Data_Analysis
* Among those who have already credit  policy ,shows higher fico value .

* Mostly customer log annual income range is from 10 to 13.

## Data_Preprocessing
* Encoding the loan defaulter target column as 1 and 0
* Dropping three features 'SLNO','Candidate Ref' and 'Location' dueto high cardinality
* Applying one hot encoding  to  'Purpose'  feature.
* Used drop_first feature of one hotencoding to avoidmulticollinearity


## Model_Building
* Random Forest  performs better than other models.
* It has a higher accuracy of 84.62%.
* False postive is almost conteibute to the wrong prediction.
* Rest of the models have verypoor performance in terms of predicting true negative values
* True negative values are crucialbecause it is important to know who will be probable loan defaulter.

## Result
* Random Forest  classifier outperforms here among all model with 84.62%% accuracy
* Top 4 important features = 'interest rate', 'Annual Income', 'fico', 'days with credit line.


## Business_Recommendation
* Institute  should focus on 4 important features 'interest rate', 'Annual Income', 'fico', 'days with credit line.
* Institute  should introduce new offering/schemes  based on these 4 features combination so that loan default  can reduce.
